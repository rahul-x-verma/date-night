# Date Night

A simple chatbot application I made to 

- Experiment with tool calling and combining an LLM with API calls to obtain information about the real world
- Try out Cursor

The app interviews a couple about their dinner preferences, then calls the Google Maps API to find a suitable nearby restaurant.

To try it out, create a .env file with your address and API keys for OpenAI and Google Maps, and just run `docker compose up`
